# HTML Overlay Demo

Simple test bench to show how to **pop up** an overlay window mimicking a **dialog box**, modal or not, with an optional auto-close on timeout

This overlay window has a upper-right **closing cross**, a **title**, a **message**, and **four buttons**, **all optional**

I's also possible to add an action function to those buttons and decide whether or not pushing those buttons will close the overlay

## Bonus

In addition, this page demonstrates how to have a vertical scroll bar on only a part *contents* part of a project, keeping the *header* part always on top of the window, even when the window is resized
